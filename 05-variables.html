    //this prints the value of the variable1 to the console.

    //it would be 3!

    let calculation = 2 + 2;
    //this makes a variable named calculation sand saves the result of the math equation as a number.

    console.log(calculation + 2);
    //this would pull the variable into the equation. it could have been a word but it wouldn't have done the mathematics

    //this same rule apply to items variables hold
    let result = calculation + 2;
    //The result would be 6 still. it pulls the variables for calculation and + 2. it then saves this value in the variable result.

    let message = 'Hello';
    console.log(message);
    //saved a string and printed it to the console

    //let created the variable
    //attach the item next
    //const also declares a variable - but can never be changed

    variable1 = 5;
    //this changes the value of the variable1 into the value 5. this would also change any commands ran onto it.... however. this didn't change till later so all prior code still reflects correctly. 
    console.log(variable1);
    //new value after it was declared
    //in addition, notice you don't declare it with let again.
    variable1 = varible1 + 1;
    //this will pull the variable1 value, add one, and save it back.
    console.log(variable1);
    //this now is 6!
